A fresh brand new CD with songs that kick uhm... you know what, and conveys powerful messages. Its all about the average person on the street and how we can relate to each other through common issues we face as humans. Take for instance the concept of time and how we never seem to have enough of it. Truly time fies like a frightened bird but we leave footprints behind in the sands of time.\r\n\r\nThe album wishes to capture some of these life experiences and lessons like a snapshot. We all face different seasons in our lives and as the songs were written over a long period of time it reflects different spheres of existence for instance from heartache to happiness it strives to be heartfelt and sincere. For this reason every song is unique with its own style and approach catering for people with different tastes and preferences. Therefore no matter who you are or what your background may be, i believe the Album caters for everybody and that in some strange way we are all able to relate.\r\n\r\nIronically while making this Album it was never a race against time! We truly took our time during the production putting as much care into every detail possible. The Album was recorded at Time line studios and produced by Dawid Jooste and Bruce Wallace. Now these guys are serious fun and really good at what they do. We had such a blast in the studio! Yes, yes in a way of speaking but also literally. I was privileged to work with a bunch of artists that are so talented and real with names like Mauritz Lotz, Johan Rautenbach, Denny Lalouette, Evert van Niekerk, Derrick Ruthven, Bruce Wallace and Dawid Jooste all well known artists in the Industry. Therefore i believe the result is the effort of collective genius.\r\n\r\nIt has been truely amaizing to see how the right people at the right time just crossed my path. Fate, destiny or the hand of God? I beleive the latter. The reality is that we all have something to say, and we all have been given ways to do so. Therefore i cannot emphasize this enough. This Album was written for your pleasure and enjoyment. Deep, alluring, at times a bit mysterious, it still conveys the truth about ourselves and society that we simply cannot deny.', 'Flight of Time_1246902982.jpg');

There is no other human motivation."\r\n\r\nHmmm...I ponder the saying while trying to figure out where risk fits in the bigger scheme of things. Love moves us to risk. Fear keeps us from risking. It is the love for someone or something that moves us to take that leap of faith, and leap over the cliff.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the danger of taking the plunge or tasting defeat. Sometimes we do not fear disappointment or failure the most but the cutting remarks of those who rejoice to see us fail.\r\n\r\nDenis Waitley says "Failure should be our teacher, not our undertaker. Failure is delay, not defeat; it is a temporary detour, not a dead end. Failure is something we can only avoid by doing nothing, by saying nothing and being nothing."\r\n\r\nLife demands risk from us. In our work environment, in our relationships, it even demands risk from us by being open to new ideas. Every day is a risk.\r\n\r\nLiving is a form of not being sure, not knowing what next or how. So how do we move in love to overcome fear?\r\n\r\nTo embrace risk responsibly ...if ever there is such a thing!\r\n\r\nDo you just close your eyes while standing at the edge, hope for the best and jump?\r\n\r\nAlthough one might consider sound judgment and gut feel too before making a giant leap of faith, the unknown provides no comfort. There''s simply no guarantees that things will work out fine. Still... it''s the same unknown that brings the thrill of anticipation, gets our hearts pounding and makes us feel alive. It brings a small piece of hope. Faith that all will be ok.\r\n\r\nWith risk there is always the hope of some kind of reward. It''s a gamble we are willing to take because we believe the reward outweighs possible losses, or that the reward will improve our current circumstances.\r\n\r\nTo all those who face risk along with us daily: "Reach for the moon. Even if you miss it you will land among the stars." ~Les Brown\r\n\r\nI consider that while thinking about the cliff scenario. "Yeah right!" I think. "What if the landing is really hard? Even fatal? How do you survive a blow like that?" I guess you pick yourself up from the floor and try again. Holding unto the true source of strength, and drawing strength from the assurance that you are loved regardless if you succeed or not. After all love is stronger than fear.\r\n\r\nOne of my all time favorite quotes summarize this beautifully: "It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly.. who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who have never known neither victory nor defeat." ~ Teddy Roosevelt', NULL),

(9, '2008-11-07 00:09:38', '', '1203976800', 'Emotion the essence of expression', 'How much is emotion part of our expression?', 'The unconscious want truth\r\nIt ceases to speak to those\r\nWho want something else\r\nMore than truth\r\n~ Adrienne Rich\r\n\r\nWhen we respond to art, we are responding to its resonance in terms of our own experience. When we see something that speaks to us in a very personal way, we find that we can associate with it even calling it our own. Ministering its meaningfulness to us, it is this connection that makes art desirable, beautiful, the mirror to our souls for those that create but also for those that behold. To create art like this requires us to be truthful and sincere to ourselves and others. I have found through other artists work that there is no clearer voice in art than that of "genuine". Because as soon as we hear that voice, our own start to sing along with it whether we want it to or not. For some it is uncomfortable to hear that voice pipe up that they spend a lifetime trying to still yet for others it is the substance of life.\r\n\r\nTo be truthful and honest with yourself I believe is one of the bravest things one can do. To know yourself and to be comfortable with who you are, give others the freedom to accept themselves and to be themselves around you. The sense of being accepted is the greatest gift you can give anyone; The passerby on the street, the mans grip still warm in your handshake and those that share your heart or home. How many of us long to be understood and then accepted? Isn''t that the purest form of love? Was Jesus the only one who could kneel beside a beggar and know his thoughts? Touch a leper and truly see the person under that disease without shunning away? I think the world needs more of that type of people showing that type of love. I wish I could see less of myself and more of the bigger picture.\r\n\r\nIf art speaks in the voice of genuine, then the language it speaks is that of emotion. And this finds its way to us through expression. The artist chooses a medium to convey a message, a message greater than the artist himself. Without the message there is no reason to create except for the vanity of fame and self-focus, that any respectable artist can tell you are no reward. The medium becomes the vessel of transfer. Like a great ship it carries the message across the sea to a new country, foreign land in the hope that it will be received, even honored.\r\n\r\nA while back I saw a painting that touched me, speaking through the emotion it aroused in my heart. Immediately I wanted to own the painting, for the feeling it portrayed was already mine.\r\n\r\nI believe the artist is more the instrument than the author of the work. We give more of an interpretation to the inspiration God has given us. Without a higher calling to create, there is no reason to create. Julia Cameron in her international bestselling book " The Artist''s way" agrees on this point when she states: "As artists we need to create freely, allowing errors to reveal themselves later as insights. We often get mired in getting the details right. We correct our originality into a uniformity that lacks passion and spontaneity."\r\n\r\nTherefore I believe one should capture emotion in a moment, that same emotion that inspired that moment becomes the life of the artwork, that draws to itself and feed on that emotion through those that behold it. I think I rightfully make the statement that we cannot create without emotion nor appreciate art without the help of emotion. Without this language of interpretation art is just a pretty picture, a nice melody, a bunch of meaningless words that cannot find their way into our lives.', NULL),
(10, '2008-11-07 00:07:48', '', '1213218000', 'It''s not the Chocolates Fault', 'Something for all the amazing people out there!', 'I was running out the office when I noticed the saying the guy had stuck against his wall: "I don''t know what the key to success is, but I know the key to failure is trying to please everybody". Stop. Think. Scroll back up, read it again.\r\n\r\nI don''t think it is possible to please everybody. Especially those unhappy with themselves. No matter what you offer them they will always be discontent, because their internal conflict fuels their dissatisfaction and nothing becomes good enough or enjoyable to these people. I am not talking envy that is the green root of so many evils. I am referring to a general displeasure with everything and everyone.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the week as artist and performer you get bombarded with compliments but also with comments of criticism. One always has to consider from whom the comment comes from and for what purpose they are saying it. Somebody pointed out that only people below you can attempt to drag you down, its impossible for those above you. And those that help you up, you take along with you.\r\n\r\nIt is a sad thing that our society more readily hands out negative remarks than up building commentary. I don''t know if they are inspired by the evening news... but what I do know that it is a bad attitude accompanied by a worse mindset. How many of us have memories of hurtful words spoken during early childhood that left scars and insecurities for life? Mean and spiteful words that so many carry with them and keep people from daring to be all they can be and reach their full potential.\r\n\r\nIt is said for every degrading thing some-one says to you; your brain needs to hear seven good things to cancel out that negative word that was spoken to you. The mind is indeed like a computer and what you say and what others say about you is what you program it with. As you think, so you are. What you think you will become and what you believe to be true will become true for you.\r\n\r\nProverbs 23:7 says "For as you think in your heart, so you are" and again in Proverbs 18:21 "Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that indulge in it shall eat the fruit of it.." Therefore it is SO important to tell some-one when you have a positive thought regarding them. To compliment the lady at work on her dress that makes her look fabulous, to express your thought to the colleague whose new ideas and creative mind you admire or the old lady at the flower shop with the deep blue eyes. To tell those people the good thoughts you have regarding them. To make their day. To give credit where it is due.\r\n\r\nHanding out sunshine does not cost a thing and it is contagious like a smile. Compliments are supposed to be free and unconditional. Complimenting God on his handiwork and appreciating it is acceptable. In fact God says in Proverbs 3:27-28 "Do not withhold good from those who deserve it, when it is in your power to act" (NIV) Therefore do not withhold a good word when it''s in your power to give it.\r\n\r\nI think of Jesus and His life on earth and even being perfect, he couldn''t please everybody. He was God for goodness sake and still he had his fans and foes.\r\n\r\nEvery-one craves acceptance and recognition even tough we are all different we all have something worthy of praise. If you are one of those who says "well but what if he gets a big head if I compliment him huh?" I can only say to you: if you have to give a compliment for every bad word spoken during a lifetime you better bring on the compliments. Don''t be stingy. To make up for others bad comments, you have a LOT of complimenting to do!!\r\n\r\nA person that seems to be arrogant or proud is only compensating for the very insecurities you can help by complimenting them in anyway. But just to be safe make sure you are always sincere and without ulterior motives. Being hard and critical on ourselves can so easily become a habit that we so graciously extend to others. But being gentle on ourselves and patient with others can prove to be a virtue of great worth not only for ourselves but also for those who share our daily life.\r\n\r\nSure we all have preferences and tastes do differ. Some people have a great weakness for chocolate, others for biltong and others crave coffee like it is the breath of life they need to sustain their existence. Others can''t stand coffee and think chocolate is just too rich (by the way I am praying for those people). But the truth of the matter is, every one has the right to differ in taste. Some will like chocolate, others will love it yet others will hate it. It is not the chocolates fault! \r\n\r\nJust the same some people will like you, others will love you and yet some will inevitably hate you. And its not your fault!! You can only be the best you can be, by being all that God intended you to be. So next time some-one insults you for being chocolate instead of coffee remember... its not the chocolates fault!!\r\n\r\nWillard F. Harley Jr. wrote in his book "The One" about his experience. He says "I was a psychology professor teaching graduate and undergraduate courses for ten years, and during that time I taught many different courses. But the one I enjoyed most teaching was Introduction to Psychology, because it offered me an opportunity to present my discipline as the sumptuous buffet of fascinating topics that it is. During each class, I provided a demonstration to illustrate some aspect of the days topic. And one day I offered the "beauty contest." A female volunteer was the judge, and five male volunteers were the contestants. \r\n\r\nThe judge was connected to electrodes, and I measured her galvanic skin response (GSR), which was the change in her skin resistance to electrical current. You see, whenever any of us has an emotional reaction, it can be measured in our skin resistance, which becomes lower. Then as we recover our composure, our skin resistance rises again. In my beauty contest, I wanted to know which of our five contestants would give our judge the biggest and most consistent emotional buzz. In other words, which one would she find the most emotionally attractive? One way to discover the answer was to measure her GSR for each contestant.\r\n\r\nEach of the five male volunteers stood in front of the judge for about thirty seconds.  He was not to say or do anything. The meter that measured her skin resistance was visible to the class, and they recorded the change, but they were not to react to the measurement. Then our female judge would have only thirty seconds to recover before the next contestant would have the chance to impress her. We went through the process three times, changing the order of appearance each time. After the contest was over, the class had the opportunity to ask the judge whether her change in skin resistance was a true indicator to her attraction to the winner.\r\n\r\nEvery time I offered this demonstration, the judge would admit that the contest winner was indeed the one she liked the most. After the contest was over I suggested that the winner take the judge out on a date at least once, because we had witnessed scientific evidence for "chemistry". What I did find was that the winner for every judge tends to be different for another judge. And the level of reaction would be different. One man would elicit no reaction at all for one of the judges but would cause the needle to go off the meter for another. My beauty contest demonstrated a phenomenon that we all know to be true - some people find us more attractive than others. It also demonstrated something most of us know - beauty is in the eye of the beholder. What is ho-hum to one person is wow! to another.\r\n\r\nWith these instincts in mind, I''ve found it useful to classify all humanity into four groups: the Lovers, the Likers, the Disikers and the Haters. The lovers are those who like just about everything there is about you. They like the way you look, the way you talk, the way you think, and the way you react to things. And the more they get to know you the more attracted they tend to become. Likers are also attracted to you, but they notice a few flies in the ointment. If they think it is rude to be critical, you may never know about their negative reactions. But if they are honest their occasional suggestions for your improvement will slip out. \r\n\r\nIf you have spoken to anyone who tends to be very critical of you, you are probably talking to a Disliker. These people find most of what you are and do to be substandard, but they are charitable enough to give you a chance to meet their standards. It is very difficult for theses people to avoid being judgmental, because so much what you do irritates them. \r\n\r\nThen there are the Haters. These are the people who don''t like anything about you. From their perspective, you are hopelessly unappealing. You rarely hear any criticism from this group because they cannot stand to be around you long enough to criticize you. Besides, from their perspective there is nothing you can do to redeem yourself. \r\n\r\nOf course your Lovers, Likers, Dislikers, and Haters are different from mine. Each of us has our own unique grouping of all humanity because people react to each one of us differently. My experience as professor brought me face to face with some of my Lovers, Likers, Dislikers and Haters. I had a captive audience and I asked them to anonymously critique my teaching. Some students thought I was their best teacher and others gave me an above average rating. But some thought I needed to improve a great deal to meet their standards, and a few thought I should give up teaching entirely and get into some other career where I wouldn''t annoy so many people.\r\n\r\nWhat intrigued me about these evaluations was that I was doing the same things when I was with all four types of students. But they reacted differently. I was perfectly suited to teach some of these students, while for some I was their worst nightmare. The more people I get to know, the more impressed I am with how some are meant to be with others. Those I find delightful are often considered boring by others I know. And those I find downright disgusting have friends who find them entertaining.\r\n\r\nThis insight has made me very reluctant to try to change people''s tastes or their preferences. After all, what right do I have to tell people what they should like, when there are thousands of people who will like the very things I dislike?"\r\n\r\nJip some serious deep words by Harley that provides some food for thought. If you have read this and enjoyed it - join the club. If you found it intensely boring and it didn''t make you think at all - good for you - that''s your right I guess. But to all my Lovers and Likers out there that enjoys the music, support the cause and like reading this blog. I just want to say: you are special to me; I appreciate you and thank you for just being the most amazing bunch of people I know. You guys rock!!!\r\n\r\nYou are definitely my chocolate. ;)', NULL),

Here are some facts about the 1500s:\r\n\r\nMost people got married in June because they took their yearly bath in May, and still smelled pretty good by June. However, they were starting to smell, so brides carried a bouquet of flowers to hide the body odor. Hence the custom today of carrying a bouquet when getting married.\r\n\r\nBaths consisted of a big tub filled with hot water. The man of the house had the privilege of the nice clean water, then all the other sons and men, then the women and finally the children. Last of all the babies. By then the water was so dirty you could actually lose someone in it. Hence the saying, Don''t throw the baby out with the Bath water...\r\n\r\nHouses had thatched roofs-thick straw-piled high, with no wood underneath. It was the only place for animals to get warm, so all the cats and other small animals (mice, bugs) lived in the roof When it rained it became slippery and sometimes the animals would slip and fall off the roof. Hence the saying . It''s raining cats and dogs.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to stop things from falling into the house...\r\n\r\nThis posed a real problem in the bedroom where bugs and other droppings could mess up your nice clean bed. Hence, a bed with big posts and a sheet hung over the top afforded some protection. That''s how canopy beds came into existence.\r\n\r\nThe floor was dirt. Only the wealthy had something other than dirt. Hence the saying, ''dirt poor''. The wealthy had slate floors that would get slippery in the winter when wet, so they spread thresh (straw) on floor to help keep their footing. As the winter wore on, they added more thresh until, when you opened the door, it would all start slipping outside. A piece of wood was placed in the entrance way. Hence the saying a threshold.\r\n\r\n(Getting quite an education, aren''t you?)\r\n\r\nIn those old days, they cooked in the kitchen with a big kettle that always hung over the fire. Every day they lit the fire and added things to the pot. They ate mostly vegetables and did not get much meat. They would eat the stew for dinner, leaving leftovers in the pot to get cold overnight and then start over the next day. Sometimes stew had food in it that had been there for quite a while. Hence the rhyme, Peas porridge hot, peas porridge cold, peas porridge in the pot nine days old...\r\n\r\nSometimes they could obtain pork, which made them feel quite special. When visitors came over, they would hang up their bacon to show off. It was a sign of wealth that a man could, bring home the bacon. They would cut off a little to share with guests and would all sit around and chew the fat...\r\n\r\nThose with money had plates made of pewter. Food with high acid content caused some of the lead to leach onto the food, causing lead poisoning death. This happened most often with tomatoes, so for the next 400 years or so, tomatoes were considered poisonous.\r\n\r\nBread was divided according to status. Workers got the burnt bottom of the loaf, the family go t the middle, and guests got the top, or the upper crust.\r\n\r\nLead cups were used to drink ale or whisky. The combination would sometimes knock the imbibers out for a couple of days. Someone walking along the road would take them for dead and prepare them for burial. They were laid out on the kitchen table for a couple of days and the family would gather around and eat and drink and wait and see if they would wake up. Hence the custom of holding a wake.\r\n\r\nEngland is old and small and the local folks started running out of places to bury people. So they would dig up coffins and would take the bones to a bone-house, and reuse the grave. When reopening these coffins, 1 out of 25 coffins were found to have scratch marks on the inside and they realised they had been burying people alive. So they would tie a string on the wrist of the corpse, lead it through the coffin and up through the ground and tie it to a bell. Someone would have to sit out in the graveyard all night, ''the graveyard shift'', to listen for the bell - thus, someone could be, saved by the bell or was considered a ''dead ringer''.\r\n\r\nAnd that''s the truth...\r\n\r\nNow, whoever said history was boring ! ! !', NULL),

There are butterflies in your stomach and your palms are moist with sweat...\r\n\r\nNo you are not in love, you are on a rollercoaster ride.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that hormones called opiates are released in your body during a roller coaster ride. The same hormones produced by being in love, exercising, sex, sunbathing, eating chocolate and the experience of beauty and art. In short the things that makes us happy. Theses brain chemicals called neurotransmitters are released and associated with pleasurable activities by the brain. Serotonin, Dopamine and Endorphins produce feelings of intense pleasure and relieve pain.\r\n\r\nFoods with a high-fat, high sugar combination, as well as alcohol have been shown to increase the production of endorphins and a response in the brain similar to morphine. Anything that will cause these natural opiates to be released will likely become something we desire and crave. Drugs that have the same effects described above include antidepressants, heroin, cocaine and other stimulants that can lead to serious addictions.\r\n\r\nThe "runners high" is a result of the release of endorphins in the brain. This grueling act of self-discipline rewards with a sense of well being that is experienced through endorphin release. This is the reason why so many people seem to become dependant on this natural high by becoming addicted to exercise, which is truly a mood altering experience.\r\n\r\nMaintaining an internal state of balance is the main function of the brain in regard to appetite and pleasure. If you become overly stressed, your brain will sense low levels of certain chemicals and will immediately begin to make the needed adjustments to bring about balance. Your brain will want to make you do whatever activity has been shown in the past to release more of the neurotransmitters that will create a sense of calmness and peace. Try as you might, you can''t ignore your brain, and it will continue to drive you to seek substances or activities that will bring about pleasure until it feels it has been sufficiently satisfied.\r\n\r\nOur brain learns what it is that we do to bring pleasure or restore balance, and it keeps track of information. Not everyone "learns" the same things; therefore, we may respond very differently to the brains call for pleasure seeking behavior. Our brain remembers what has brought about needed changes in the past and will drive us toward those activities again and again. One person may have learned to eat "comfort foods" (most likely ones that are high in carbohydrates) when feeling stressed, while another may have experimented with alcohol or drugs to achieve the same result. Anything you have associated with a sense of pleasure at some time in the past is a candidate for future use when your brain is seeking balance. \r\n\r\nAppetite is influenced by the imprint of past forms of coping and seeking pleasure. There are connections between events and the use of certain substances and behaviors to relieve the pain associated with the events. The process of learning about various pleasure sources should give us all hope. If the brain has learned what it will seek for pleasure or balance, then it can "relearn" new and healthier forms of activity and foods to achieve a state of well-being. So there is hope in overcoming unhealthy pleasure seeking.\r\n\r\nInterestingly substances or behaviors can increase or decrease serotonin or dopamine, but we must remember that the expectation of the outcome has more to do with the release of the pleasure-control chemicals than anything else. The right substance with the wrong expectations will yield nothing in the area of satisfaction or pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe word amuse according to the Oxford dictionary is defined as "to make time pass pleasantly for oneself or somebody or to make somebody laugh or smile."\r\n\r\nCollins dictionary adds "to entertain or keep interested."\r\n\r\nThere seems from the beginning of time that the need to entertain or amuse existed for human kind. Maybe the man that came up with the amusement park concept was aware of the need of healthy pleasure seeking as well. Maybe the first rollercoaster ride design was the anticipated thrill or someone''s idea of fun.\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly Amusement parks all started with pleasure gardens. These were located in Medieval Europe and had live entertainment, fireworks, dancing, games and some rides. They were popular until the 1700s when political situations caused a lot of them to close down. Bakken, a pleasure garden north of Copenhagen, is still standing. It opened in 1583 and with the world''s oldenst operating amusement park.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1800s amusement parks started taking hold in the United States. Most amusement parks were built at the end of a trolley line. They usually had picinic areas, dance halls, restaurants, games and a few rides. They were immediately successful! In 1893, amusement parks started to become extremely popular. The World''s Columbian Exposition in Chicago introduced the ferris wheel and the midway. The midway had a wide variety of rides and concessions and largely influenced amusement park design.\r\n\r\nIn 1894, Paul Boynton opened the world''s first modern amusement park, Paul Boynton''s Water Chutes. It charged admission and used rides to draw people to it. In 1895, he also opend a park at Coney Island. Coney Island was central to the amusment park industry. Once it had three big amusement parks, plus smaller attractions.\r\n\r\nOver the years, trolley parks expanded, new amusement parks opened and new rides were created. Over 1,500 amusement parks were opened by 1919 in the United States. During the Great Depression, amusement park attendance went down greatly. In, 1935, there were only about 400 amusement parks and World War II didn''t help matters. Many parks closed during the war and others had to stop adding new rides in order to stay open. After World War II, amusement parks had a sudden popularity boom. New parks opened as more and more people came.\r\n\r\nDisneyland opened in 1955 as a themed park and was an immediate success. Theme parks are still enjoying success. New technology is creating types of rides that were once unattainable.\r\n\r\nThe top thrill dragster is located in Van Cedar point Ohio USA and was built on 05-04-2003. It boast a length of 853,4m and a height of 128m. The drive starts at a height of 121,9m and reaches a maximum speed of 193,1 km/h (the fastest in the world). It excellerates from 0 to 193 km/h in 4 seconds. The cost to produce such a pleasure producing machine... $25 million. But if you think this ride is too far or too wild you can visit our local amusement parks like Gold Reef City, Retanga Junction for your dose of pleasure chemicals.', NULL),

What makes you happy?', '"Love is blind\r\nBut friendship is clairvoyant"\r\n\r\nHave I mentioned I really love this blog site. The reason you guys only get one blog a month is because I write not because I believe I must, but more because I feel I must share the things that I can''t live without. So months may go by when I feel I have nothing to say, I call them dry seasons. That''s the time when you should listen rather than speak. Learn instead of always being the wise one. And truly see, taking in the environment around you. (By the way I am talking about myself here). I ask myself why these dry seasons so much represent winter on all fonts of our lives. During the winter the trees grow in the roots while to all appearances they look dead. So in times when we experience creative dry seasons, we must soak in our surroundings until one day we realize spring has arrived and we burst forth with new ideas.\r\n\r\nI am for one glad it''s spring. This is my favorite time of the year because of the weather. Usually as a person I also enter a new cycle of learning about my own psyche, and the people around me at this time. It''s a time for insights and new stimuli for the senses.  What floats your boat? What keeps you grounded? What makes you come alive? Yeah, yeah, what makes you flower like the early spring blossom on a lone branch? lol\r\n\r\nBy the way I am so tired of these one way conversations I am having. Please we need some interaction from people to spark some really interesting conversation! Things get good as soon as you mix a few opinions and start to get to know people in a personal way... Who knows maybe we can even chat about religion and politics, haha, we are fearless we don''t mind going there ;) The scary thing is we all have our own opinions and our own religion. Take the atheist for instant. Though he would deny he''s got any form of belief, he still refuses to believe in God... smile... that''s still a belief. See now is the perfect opportunity to invite people to a chat room to get their honest opinions about this type of stuff. Get the fists flying and the steam blood pressure rising? You have to excuse me I am a sucker for debate and conversation (I really can''t help it, philosophy is in my nature). These online conversations can get VERY funny at times too!\r\n\r\nBut back to my initial subject. I recently posted a blog named "The Pleasure Principle" some very interesting reading for those who missed it by the way. It comes down to the fact that we all associate something with Happiness. And your brain will constantly seek ways to push you towards it. You are not unique, all of our brains have been programmed that way. So that''s a question I would ask all of you... What''s your definition of Happiness?  Before I let you know what I think... let me know what you think. The best answer will be honored by posting it here and discussing it. Hopefully by then we will have an interactive site (to webmaster hint hint wink wink) that we can get feedback from everybody interested. Spark some conversation. Enter the debate. Your opinion is needed and important. In the meanwhile mail me your thoughts.\r\n\r\nI leave you with some definitions of Happiness to mull over.

It can also make you remember to value your friends!', '(A true tale:)\n\nI was tending the children when Luke (aged 3) came and jumped on my lap to sit there while his brother read us some jokes out of his little book. "What do you call dogs that lies at the fireplace for too long?" he asked. Shaking my head I said "I don''t know". He broke into a smile "hot dogs!"\n\n"What did the angry passenger on the aeroplane say to the noisy child? ''Why don''t you go play outside!''. We giggled.\n\nLittle Beth (aged 4) came running to join us and she found the wand that one of the kids forgot on my table. "Whose is this?" she wanted to know bright eyed. "One of the other little girls" I explained. "What is it?" she wanted to know. " It''s a magic wand" I said turning it in my hand. "The kind that grants wishes?" she asked excitingly. "Yes, I guess so" I said amused. It was a plastic wand, the kind you can get in any toy shop, but to those that believed in its ability it held immense power. "May I see it? Her eyes pleaded. "Sure", I handed it over. She first studied the stick that held a star at the end, as to ascertain its power. Then she swung it around in the air in a most powerful way. "I can grant you wishes!" she announced proudly. "Really?" I raised a skeptic eyebrow. "Yes I can!" her eyes where now fierce with her conviction. "Don''t you know I am the fairy godmother?" She asked me that question like I was supposed know that already. " Well, excuse me fairy godmother" I said " Please continue to grant me the desires of my heart". The cheeky 4 year old girl with round cheeks, big eyes and pigtails swirled in her pink dress. "What would you like?" she almost singed. "Uhmmmm... let me think sweety... like Cinderella a big gown with glass slippers" I jokingly answered. Little Beth swung the wand dramatically around her head then pointed it to me "there you go" she announced. "oh thank you!" I exclaimed.Looking at my clothes and shoes. "While you are at it grant me a orange porche instead of a pumpkin so I can go to the ball" I was getting the hang of this game I thought.rnrn"Don''t be silly" she said. "If you wish for that I will make the porche appear above you and then it will drop on top of you" Now that wasn''t the answer I expected.  "You are a sneaky little fairy godmother" almost sadistic I thought. "What else would you want?" the cute little girl wanted to know. I was sucking things out of my thumb to keep her entertained and wasn''t really putting much thought into my wishes. " What about a mansion at the sea? Or better yet a house in the mountains." I declared. With the wave of the wand and with sound effects "poof" generated by the fairy godmother the wish was graciously bestowed upon me.\n\nSuddenly a thought occurred to me: What if I was granted these wishes? Would it be what I truly want? Would it have been my serious wishes? If this was my genie in the bottle granting me 3 wishes would this be what I wish for? Definitely not!! What would I do with a pair of glass slippers? And orange is definitely not my colour!! I started to think about it. \n\nTaking this wishing business seriously. "Ok, I said. I need some more wishes". "You are starting to run out of them!" she cautioned. "But I need more!" I objected. "Hold on" she said "I need to go ask God for more wishes for you. I will be right back" She disappeared around the corner as if to go speak to the Big Boss.\n\n"What is wind?" Luke''s brother wanted to know. Luke shrugged lifting his shoulders. His brother grinned "Air in a hurry!"  He was enjoying his joke book.\n\nIn the mean while Luke was still sitting on my lap, his back facing me. He took the opportunity to play a quick game. Placing his marble in the one hand, he closed both hands behind his back saying "which hand?" he asked. It was really funny. I could see both his hands because they where facing me. I tapped his right arm which I knew contained the marble and said "this one!" he shook his head and swapped the marble to the other hand. Showing me the empty hand I have picked!! "Oh, I am bad at this!" I smirked "Lets try again. His brother seeing what Luke was doing objected: "You were right! He is switching hands!" I nodded "I know, his back is facing me, I can see everything." I winked.\n\n"What do men do standing up, woman do sitting down, and dogs do on three legs?" I was afraid to answer that one. "No, tell us" I said. "Shake hands" he said.\n\nThe fairy godmother returned skipping." God says it''s ok; he will grant you three more wishes. But you can''t wish for jackets. We are out of them." By now the situation was becoming precious. I could hardly suppress my smile. "I need more than three wishes sweetheart" I said shaking my head. She was rocking to the sides "Well what would you wish for with theses?" I thought for a moment. "I would wish for True love" I said. She waved her wand and with a "ping" the wish was granted. "Next" she said. This fairy godmother was running a deadline. She was a no-nonsense businesswoman.  "I would wish to always be able to love God and to know him" she twirled and spinning said "Ok. There you go!" Hmmm.. I thought what if these wishes where really granted? That could be nice. "Remember you cant wish for jackets" the fairy God mother cautioned. I nodded. "I wish I could sing forever" I said. "Open your mouth!" She said. Pointing the wand into my mouth she said "ting!"\n\nBefore my fairy could realize I was running out of wishes I made a few more (luckily she wasn''t counting). "I wish for health and happiness" "Ta da!" "And I wish to have my friend back" Her little finger went to her mouth and her eyes turned upward as if thinking. "Is your friend a boy or a girl?" she asked. "It''s a boy" I said. She sighed "that''s going to be difficult". Shaking her head se said " I will have to go ask God if he can do that". Off she ran again. "What has a mouth, and a fork, yet never eats?" We shook our heads. Strange that they always waited for you to say "I don''t know" before they gave you the answer. "A river".\n\nLuke piped up "I have a wish! I want to be spiderman!" For a 3 year old boy the wish was legit. "And I want to be invisible! And I want to be able to fly!" At this age it already showed the male species desire to be strong and powerful, whereas the girls just wanted to be beautiful and desired. I marveled how this was reflected in my own wishes about silly glass slippers and ballroom dresses. As girls we just wanted to be admired.\n\nHis brother interrupted Luke''s day dreaming "You only get three wishes silly! Think carefully about what you want and then make the wishes". How age brought wisdom along with it. Luke thought for a second then said "In that case" he took his finger and pointing it at my forehead touching it while making his wish "I wish you no clothes!" Then he looked at me with expectant eyes awaiting his wish to come true.\n\nI think that also represented probably more of the male species day to day wishes than would ever be admitted by them. I started to laugh. Boys just want to admire beauty. \n\nThe book Wild at heart by John Eldridge and the sequence Captivating is a must read to understand the natures of both men and woman. I highly recommend these  two books as some of the best reading material I have ever read. If you only read two books your entire lifetime make it these two. I promise you won''t regret it!\n\n"What does the sea say to the sand?" We all put on our clueless look. "Not a lot - it mostly waves!"\n\n"Oh, oh, and hear this one!" he added excitingly: "Did you hear about the wooden car with a wooden engine and wooden wheels?"\n"It wooden go!" \n\nMy fairy was back again. And her answer was "Yes, you can have your friend back!" I was glad. My family and friends are my treasure and the riches of this world. I am the richest and happiest person alive because of them. People alone are what you get to take with you to heaven. Good memories and amazing people are the only things you get to take along. They say friends are the family we get to choose. I believe that. \n\nI was afraid I would loose my friends and family the people I loved the most. I wanted them to be safe. Forever safe in life and in my heart. If only we could keep the people we care about shielded from this world and its hurt. Like these children unaware of the world of danger outside the boundaries of the play area. But that was a wish that was not always possible. It was a prayer that God in his goodness granted us: safety for our loved ones. What else could I possibly want from this world? I looked at the sweet little faces in front of me.\n\n"This is your last wish" the fairy godmother reminded me. I gave Luke a light squeeze and looked at my fairy godmother. "I would one day love to have wonderful little boys and girls like you lot."\n\nShe smiled pointing her wand at my belly and said:\n\n"Fat!"', NULL);

We look at people that are famous on TV or on the front of a magazine and we value them more as Human beings. We look at people that have more money and things and think they are better than the average guy and gal. We look at others who live seemingly significant lives because they are rich, beautiful, influential or powerful and we look at ordinary and simple despising those. I have realized you don''t need fame or fortune to be happy. You don''t have to be popular to be extraordinary. You don''t have to achieve something great to be a great person. Some of the greatest things people do go unseen and unheard of in this world. Invent an atom bomb and your name might be carved in the hallways of remembrance for a time and you might receive a Nobel Prize. Being a mom and rearing a child can be one of the noblest tasks and the greatest achievements of our life. A kindness or favor preformed to someone in need won''t go unnoticed with God. A good word of encouragement spoken every now and then can be both a blessing to the one giving it and the one receiving it. Truly loving someone I believe is the greatest achievement of all time. Helping others you don''t even know. And in the extreme form being good to people that treat you as their enemy. Knowing God and walking with Him I believe is the key to true happiness. Surrendering your life to him gives you contentment and you don''t need to be striving to prove yourself to the world. You know who you are, you are happy with yourself and content with where you are at in your life. Don''t get me wrong, we must strive to become the best we can be, but we don''t need to become someone else for the sake of other people. Simple things in life can be enjoyed and simple things can bring astounding happiness.\n\nYesterday morning as I was reading psalm 119 aloud, a wild dove (one of those small gray birds) flew through my open window and came sitting on my head. What a delight. The bird spends the next 3 hours with me like a visitor from heaven. He even flew down to sit on my Bible to mark the page, hehe. Then I lay on my bed and the dove jumped on my stomach, puffing itself up ready for a nap. What could I do? I lay there for a while just studying this strange trusting bird. I was looking at that bird and admiring the genius of the design and I could no help saying to it: "Your God and My God. He made us both. And you must know him too" It says somewhere in the Bible that not one bird falls from the sky without God knowing it. They are also his creatures. He also cares for them. How much more does he care for us, his children?\n\nAfter a while I needed to get up and get ready for work, and the weird thing was it kept following me around my room. Walking on the floor, jumping on my dresser, picking at the perfume bottles and hair\nbrushes, studying the mirror. Any other dove would have been frantically flying around trying to find a way out of the room. Not this one! It was inquisitive and curious. When I went over to my closet it flew and sat on the arm post of my couch looking intently what I was doing. This was a highly intelligent bird. I even asked it if it was an angel in disguise! It felt like God was visiting me and I could not help think how things used to be when animals and humans lived together without any fear of each other. This animal did not know me but it had no fear for me. What a mystical experience that was! It was really quite adorable.  After a while it flew out my window, sat on the balcony railing looking at me as to let me know it was going to leave now, and then finally flew away. I was amazed that the dove took the courtesy of saying goodbye. I wondered why this dove was alone. These kinds were always seen together. But I was grateful that it was free. Free to come and go. Free to leave. It would be cruel to place a bird like that in a cage. Birds have to roam free. They have to dance in the skies. They must fly.\n\nIt made me realize. Every person no matter where they live, what they do or who they are, we all have quite unique stories to tell. Each of us is truly extra-ordinary in our own way. We have more in common than we will ever be willing to admit. We are part of the same family after all. Even tough we might not all sing the same song and each of our voices is unique. We are still birds of the same feather.\n\n8 October 2008\nToday the magic continued as two doves pitched at my window this morning. A different species from the one that came around yesterday. These where whitish with dark rings around their necks and they came in a pair. I fetched some bread and the one immediately started to eat out of my hand. The other one was more cautious with the look in his eye: Never trust a free meal. But after a while he also joined in the festivities. They sat on the balcony railing as I fed them, but they never flew into my room and only stayed for the free food. Made me wonder if the birds also had a network where they spread news and interesting conversations? How else did these two know they can trust me and get free food if they pitched at this ladies window? And it made we wonder about that other bird that came around yesterday. It never ate any food I gave it. It wasn''t there for the food but the company. And that''s not animal behavior at all!! Like most people the animal''s notion is: what can I get out of you? Or what can I get from you? LOL usually its food. But the bird from yesterday was after love and connection. Maybe it was God in the form of a dove? Or maybe the explanation is simple. My sister reared a pink little helpless dove a year back. She found it on the ground, not a nest in sight and took it in and cared for it. It was always sitting on her head, like a nest ;) She fed it with Pronutro and milk through a tube and when it was big enough it started to go on trips on his own, always coming back in the evenings. One day it flew off but it didn''t come back. It was a wild bird once again but with a human mom. Maybe it could be that bird? Missing the human connection for it was all he ever knew as a baby chick? Anyway this bird has made its appearance every now and then and the last time the band was chilling in the garden it swooped down and landed on "The Green man" (our drummer). Luckily we got to take a picture of this charming little bird. I think we should call the dove the "Peace" hehehe. If you can think of a good name for the birdy let me know!!\n\n10 October - Vengeance is fine\nWhat a contrast today was with the pervious two days I have been enjoying.  I wasn''t greeted by doves at the window but with wasps today. And they wasn''t friendly or peaceful at all.  I opened my glass sliding doors with the intent with sweeping my balcony when I was unpleasantly welcomed by the sting of the wasp. Aggressive little devils flying around my body very eager to pump me full of their venom. It stung like hell! Falling running ducking with my head I tried to get away from them in the process disturbing the nest they had made in a pot fill of round stones standing on my balcony.  I was furious. I retreated to the closet for some Antisan cream, thankful for the antihistamine that was definitely making a difference to the burning in my skin. Now Vengeance was in order. I think the Bible says somewhere that vengeance is mine but in this case vengeance is fine!!\n\nI had a similar experience with wasps in the past. I was wearing my swimsuit so I was not really covered to prevent their stings and when they started they didn''t want to stop stinging me. I was about eight years old then but was clever enough to figure I should jump into the swimming pool. (9 stings later I was also eager to go kill them myself, and did too). Don''t mess with me or you will get it was the motto.\n\nSo this time armed with a broom and doom I sought my revenge. In the commotion that followed the pot broke, round stones went flying in all directions (including off the balcony onto my car, that was parked below) and three stones the sizes of tennis balls rained down on the front of my car. Damaging the side panel and bonnet that had just been fixed the previous month.  Don''t ask what happened the previous month. A kid threw a brick at the school and it landed on my car. The School and the parent agreed to pay for the damage of the car. And here I was back again to square one! With nobody to blame except myself. The broom also went flying, damaging the little plant that I have been nurturing for months. It still have one leaf left... I think.\n\nYou can imagine how I felt. There I was red and starting to swell because of the poison.  Pretty angry with no-one to blame except the dead wasps and their ex-nest covered in doom. And I realized that turning the cheek would have probably saved me a lot of damage to my car. But doing the right thing is not always the easy thing to do. And it''s not nice  to turn the cheek to the wasps of life that injure us with their hurt and poison. Injustice and people treating us wrongly without cause can be poison to our systems. That leave you feeling sick and sleepy like I am feeling now. Poisoned.  What a day. Started off the wrong way. Not my day.', NULL),

Or is it simply the consequence of bad choices that rewards us with the weight of our decisions? Time to contemplate cause and effect.\n\nMy Birthday is coming up. It used to be an important day for the druids back in the age of the Stonehenge. Summer Solice. Sol + stice is derived from a combination of Latin words meaning â€˜sunâ€™ + â€˜and to stand stillâ€™. As a major celestial event, the summer solice results in the longest day and the shortest night of the year. As we live in the southern hemisphere summer solice occurs this year Descember 21 2008 at 10:04pm AEST. Maybe God stretched out my b-day by making it the longest day of the year :)\n\nThe Mayans also predicted that that time would end as we know it  (some call it the end of the world) on the 21st December 20012. The truth is none of us can forsee our expiry date. I want to look back at my life and have no regrets. Is such a thing even possible? It seems every choice we make has a profound impact on ourselves, our environment and others, to the extent that our choices do not only affect ourselves but the communal world we live in. I want to love and live like every day could be my last day. Breath after all is a gift. In my view freedom of choice was and still is the greatest gift God gave us to exercise during this life. \n\nThrough every decision we solidify ourselves in the choices we make. What do I mean by this? What first start out as a choice later almost becomes automatic behaviour that we no longer choose. Ask most guys suffering from bad habits and addictions if what I say is true: to re-program your brain is very difficult. We tend to become the choices we make. Our character is an externalisation of our choices. \nThink about it. You can tell a lot about a person and what is going on on the inside of that person by looking at their dress, their environment, their preferences, their way of life and the choices they make. We live out who we truly are on the inside. It can be seen in our eyes, our home, our garden, the condition of our car and the state of our affairs. Our mind truly is like a computer and what you program it with (put into it) is what you will get out of it. I have realised the importance of screening what goes into my mind. People try to make choices for us.  The media tells us how to dress, what to think, what to eat, it even dictates our behaviour. I donâ€™t know about you but I donâ€™t like being told â€˜to fit the moldâ€™. I like to make my own choices thank you very much. I donâ€™t like being brainwashed into thinking a certain way by the media, the masses, the music industry or even myself.  Thatâ€™s why we are in need of someones opinion that gets the bigger picture. If I am going to teach my mind new commands, itâ€™s best to start with the first ten. I think thatâ€™s why any product from a manufacturer comes with a manual. \n\nI recently concluded that we all have an internal moral grid. A sense of right and wrong. It''s wishful thinking to say morality is a matter of preference. Take a person with that point of view and cut them off at an intersection and you have committed a grave offence! If we view a story on the news of an innocent child being abducted by a pedofile abused and killed, we all feel a great sense of injustice have occurred. Our sense of moral ethics are built into us. We can all agree to it to some extent though there might be minor variations. There are also a degree of acceptance and tolerance but a distinct line exist that if crossed will make anyone see red. For instance we can tolerate someone who looses his temper because the taxi in front of him is endangering the lives of innocent people but will refuse to accept that a serial killerâ€™s behaviour is acceptable. In cases such as these something inside us screams for fairness and retribution. We demand justice. \n\nWhether it affects us directly or indirectly. Whether we believe in the Bible or not, its framework stretches through our conscience and consciousness.\n\nAnother interesting concept I recently had to examine is the extent and effect of our freedom of choice. God sacrificed a part of His control and power by handing it to us to direct and rule over our own lives. Heâ€™s not responsible for the choices we make, neither can He be blamed for the consequences of our choices, but in all fairness He did warn us of the consequences. It seems freedom of choice is essential for love to be free. No one of us want to force someone to love us. We want them to choose it out of their own free will, then alone does love mean anything. The same with God â€“ He couldâ€™ve chosen for us to be mindless, heartless, soulless robots, that would always make the right decisions, but we would never be able to choose love nor be capable of it.\n\nIn order to choose love, a choice must exist for love to be free. This is the greatest priority of God and His plan for the universe: Love. This concept is explained in Dr. Gregory Boydâ€™s book â€˜Letters for a Skepticâ€™. Freedom of choice cannot exist without the possibility to either choose goodness (love) or evil (hate). He compares it to the three sides of a pyramid that must co-exist. If you really think about it, every choice we make in live boils down to this. We either make a decision that will have goodness or love as consequence or we direct our energy and freedom of choice to choose evil or a choice fueled in hate. Using our energy to choose and utilise this freedom of choice is what it means to be human. Trying not to choose anything, I dare you, you will quickly learn that your nature will rage in protest and an internal conflict will commence until you make your choice. It makes me think of the popular poem â€œThe Road Not Taken.â€ We stand in a forest and we see two roads (two choices), the end result of our choices is not clear. We walk blindly in darkness. The author of this poem explains that he choose the road not taken by the majority of travelers. In other words, he chose the unpopular road known for its difficulty and that to him â€œhave made all the differenceâ€. The right choice is not always the easy choice. In fact expect it to be the impossible choice. The one we are most unwilling to make.', ''),

Read here about the meaning of mermaids as dream symbols', 'Mermaid, Mermen â€“ As Dream Symbols \r\n\r\n"I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.\r\nI do not think that they will sing to me." T.S. Eliot\r\n\r\nTo understand what the mer creature appearing in your dream, it is important to understand their origin in mythology. \r\n\r\nThe half human, half otherworldy mermaid appears in almost all mythologies. In fact, the first merperson recorded was not a maid at all. It was a merman known as Oannes, a Babylonian god worshipped as early as 5,000 BCE. After Oannes, we find Atargatis, the first mermaid. Atargatis was a goddess associated not only with the sea, but also of the hidden forces, intuition, and the power of destruction. Her association with the sea led to her being more or less taken over by Aphrodite who was, according to legend, created from sea foam. The gods and goddesses eventually gave birth to entire races of sea dwelling creatures, both male and female. \r\n\r\nCommon recently examples of female mermaids in our culture are those of Hans Christian Andersen''s ''The Little Mermaid''.\r\nIt is important to note, especially when interpreting this symbol, that mermaids and sirens are not synonymous. Sirens were originally creatures that were half-bird--not half-fish. The sirens were soul-eaters who lured fishermen to them in order that they might steal their souls. \r\n\r\nMermaids, on the other hand, were actually quite protective of sea-farers and used their voices to calm their jangled nerves. Thanks to the Medieval church who used mermaids as symbols of sexual temptation, they became associated with the sirens--dangerous creatures who brought destruction and death. It was even rumoured that St. Patrick turned pagan women into mermaids. This was a most horrible punishment as by this time mermaids were struck with another of the sirens'' stigma: the lack of a soul. \r\n\r\nWhen interpreting your mer-creature dream, ask a few questions.\r\n\r\nWas the creature in your dreams opposite your own sex? If so, it is probably serving as an anima/animus figure--the unconscious aspect of your self. These figures can appear in positive and negative roles and your feelings about the creature and its actions in the dream will give you clues as to what it is saying to you. \r\n\r\nIf the creature was benevolent and the feelings in the dream were pleasant, the mer creature may be standing in a Christ symbol, as the half-fish god Oannes was a precursor to Christ, who is often symbolized by what today has become known as the ''Jesus Fish''. Therefore, dreaming of a mer creatures may indicate higher consciousness or wholeness as the ''Jesus Fish'' is actually a vesica piscis, a potent symbol of individuation. \r\n\r\nIf the creature was malevolent or the feelings in the dream were less than pleasant, the mer symbol may indicate feelings of being ''drowned'' by emotions. It may also be a negative animus/anima figure, and can indicate self-sabotage or self-deception. It may also indicate feelings of feeling like you have ''lost your soul''--meaning that you have suffered a great loss but have repressed the feelings surrounding the loss. \r\n\r\nMer-creatures also convey a sense of longing, of a great desire to be understood. The merperson wants nothing more than to belong. They can, therefore also symbolize a need to speak up and use your voice to express your feelings, to be heard and comprehended. \r\n\r\nMer-creatures may also point to feelings of vulnerability. The mermaid, remember, was not a siren, but a creature who took care of those who were lost at sea. Your mer-creature may be saying that is is you who needs to be nurtured and protected.\r\n\r\nRemember, these creatures, the mermaid in particular, have been associated with love, intuition, hope, the power of the voice, and sex, but also with loss of soul, treachery, and deceit. About the only thing that is consistent with merfolk is that they live in the water realm which is the realm of the intuition, feeling, and the unconscious. Therefore, when dreaming of merpeople, it means that you are dealing with something that comes from deep within yourself. Listen to the mermaids singing--because they are, in fact, singing to you! \r\n\r\nAs always, sleep well and dream out loud!', ''),
(21, '2009-05-11 09:42:07', '1244726131', '1241992800', 'Fragile', 'Understand others by understanding yourself', 'How is it possible that you can loose everything in a moment? Sufficiently inspired by the melancholic tunes of Snow Patrol I ponder the fact that joy should not have an expiry date. Should not be contained in something so fragile, that it can broken any moment. The label on the outside of the container warns if the contents are expendable.\r\n\r\nâ€œFragileâ€ it reads, â€œThis way up.â€ Does it matter if you brake when your world is upside down , inside out, the wrong way around? Can you fix something that has been smashed into a thousand pieces? Would superglue, lots of effort and time do the trick? How do you glue someoneâ€™s heart back together again or restore trust that has been broken? What kind of glue can be used to mend the inner workings of a human being? How do you stick a soul back together again? They say time is the healer of all things, is that really so? Can time heal the cracks and chips on china? Will glue restore the clarity in clear crystal glass? Once broken, I guess always broken. Scars are after all souvenirs and evidence of previous hurts. I always try to fix things. I always believe something is worth saving. In the words of the movie Sea Biscuit â€œYou donâ€™t throw a whole life away just because it is banged up a little bit.â€\r\n\r\nAll my furniture have been rescued, restored and given a second chance where others would not have given a second thought or a second glance. I know the bumps and the grains of the wood on every desk cupboard or chair. I am familiar with hidden damages that somehow add to the charm and character of every piece. My hands have sanded down the wood and varnished every inch, and therefore every inch is precious to me. So restoration is possible, but usually requires an investment of time and energy. My mother used to say as we were growing up, that she wish she could hide us away from the harsh world in a glass box filled with cotton wool to keep us safe. What she probably meant was: stick a sticker on her kids saying â€œfragile- handle with careâ€ and hope against all odds that people will treat you as such. I for one have a horrendous time trusting that airport personnel will indeed heed the label. You receive your parcel with the arrow pointing down and you hope against all odds that whatever was inside is still intact. \r\n\r\nIt seems unfair that our very lives are contained in such perishable containers. This world is harsh. This world will kill you. You start dying the moment you are born. In truth we are all fragile inside out. Whether male or female, young or old, we all carry the same fragility in body and soul.  We all live in houses of glass. We all have been dropped by poor handling or damaged by life in one way or another. Once again secret fears of getting hurt testify to our fear of hurt. We are all woven from the same thread and thus the same moral fiber runs through us all. It encompasses us and defines us. We play our different parts in the great scheme of things but the threads are interwoven to form a pattern in the grand design of the carpet. Itâ€™s impossible for a thread to comprehend and see the whole design - only the weaver can stand back and appreciate the finished product. Housed in jars of clay we are in the truest sense only human. \r\n\r\nIf we realize others are just as fragile as we are, we might treat ourselves and others more gently. We might have more patience and forgiveness. In the same way as the furniture I described above, our imperfections and flaws testify to our need of our Creator and Restorer. Our weaknesses were placed in us on purpose!! Itâ€™s our little reminder that we do need the help and the abilities of others where we fall short. We need to be merciful towards ourselves and others. In my closet is the reminder â€œTreating myself like a precious object will make me strong.â€ Sometimes we can be our own worst enemies by treating ourselves unkind or returning the harsh treatment of others. Allow me to wrap you in cotton wool and tell you how precious you are, if you are unable to see your own beauty and worth, let me tell you what I can clearly see on the outside of the container  that contains youâ€¦ â€œFragile. Handle with care.â€', 'Fragile_1242741158.jpg');
