<h2>Influences</h2>
<p>I like all types of music, from classical to metal. I prefer to listen to various artists and I always find something about each style of music that I admire or that I can learn from.</p>

<h2>Inspirations</h2>
<p>People inspire me. We are so similar in some ways yet at the same time quite disconnected. Everybody that has come across my path of life has had such an impact on my life. The songs were written for people I knew or a real life experience I was a witness to, or experienced myself. Whenever a song comes to me I write it down. Mostly this happens in the most unexpected places! I used to write songs down on whatever I could find, from writing on the serviette in the coffee shop to writing on the back of my hand.  I have found that you can meet anyone and learn something from them, and even if you don't, you will have learned something about yourself.</p>

<h4>Local Singer Aviya takes a flight of time</h4>
<p>No name could be more suitable for this versatile young singer's first album than Flight of time.</p>
<p>Aviya does not limit herself to time or genre. Her style and voice have been likened to anything from The Cranberries and Evanessance to that of Sarah Brightman. "Every-one has a favorite song on the album, and because my songs are so diverse I believe it caters for all different types of styles and tastes. You are bound to found something you like on the album, even if it is just one song that resonates with you." She explains that she likes all types of music, and has had a wide influence from classical to metal. "Music is my passion and my life. I prefer to listen to various artists and I always find something about each style of music that I admire or that I can learn from."</p>
<p>Aviya Crest cannot be placed in the proverbial box. She is different and unconventional, yet warm and down to earth. Aviya says her unusual name means "God is my Father" in Hebrew.</p>
<p>"The main objective is to have fun and to love what you are doing on stage. Because energy is infectious and it invites people to join in and be kids again. We care far too much what others think of us at the cost of ourselves and our own happiness. The stage liberates us to be who we truly are. I believe my music contains some universal truths that is applicable to everybody and daily life. In the Movie Chariots of Fire the main Character when confronted by his sister as to why he HAS to run answers "Because when I do I feel Gods pleasure".</p>
<p>The same can be said for her motivation as to why she sings. "What I wish to achieve with my music is the hope that a song can have meaning to some-one in a specific circumstance or difficult time. If it can motivate or inspire some-one in need, help them by speaking an encouraging word or give advice. I would be thrilled if in the least it can move people to think or to consider things: just to pause and contemplate their lives, I believe the music would have served its purpose.</p>
<p>On stage her outfits are always striking. She wears romantic dresses from the Victorian era to jazzy Contemporary clothes to depict her flight trough History. "People inspire me. We are so similar in some ways and yet at the same time quite disconnected. Everybody that has come across my path of life has had such an impact on my life. The songs were written for people I knew or a real life experience I was a witness to, or experienced myself." For this reason she also used Models for the photography of her booklet. "The stories told are not all mine, and the photos depict the song, so it was just fair to use other people to tell the story of real people that is inevitably our own."</p>
<p>On being asked how the songs come to her she explains " Whenever a song comes to me I write it down. Mostly this happens in the most un-expected places! I used to write songs down on whatever I could find, from writing on the serviette in the coffee shop to writing on the back of my hand. I have found that you can meet anyone and learn something from them, and even if you don't, you will have learned something about yourself".</p>
<p>Every song on the CD described as "deep, alluring, and at times a bit mysterious is illustrated with artistic black and white photo's in the 28 pager booklet accompanying her CD that is unheard of in South-Africa. "I like trying new and different things that others are too scared to try," she says with a wink.</p>
<p>She obtained her second degree last year cum laude after studying Homeopathy and education respectively. "I love children and would like to obtain a masters degree in art or art therapy" She has gained experience in this field by teaching art and aiding disadvantaged children in townships. This is where my heart lies she explains. To help those who have little opportunity in developing themselves trough artistic expression. Helping these kids to get in touch with themselves, to discover their true potential, and purpose while getting to know the Creator who takes pleasure in his works.</p>
<p>Being an accomplished artist, her paintings have been successfully exhibited and apart from that some of Aviya`s poems have been published as well. She certainly stood in front in the queue when talents were handed out.</p>
<p>As the case with many young singers, Aviya started her singing career by participating in talent competitions and festivals. But back to her album which she describes as a slow and expensive process, using the best people in the business and taking two years to complete. The Album was recorded at time line studios and produced by David Jooste and Bruce Wallace. "Now these guys are serious fun and really good at what they do. We had such a blast at the studio! Yes I was priviledged to work with a bunch of artists that are so talented and real with names like Mauritz Lotz, Johan Rautenbach, Denny Lalouertte, Evert van Niekerk, Derrick Ruthven, Bruce Wallace and David Jooste all known artists in the Industry. The CD`s will be marketed at her shows and will be available in stores shortly.</p>
<p>Her performances on stage along with her 4 band members are known as either energetic or laidback depending on the crowd and the mood. "We like adapting and changing the program and presentation to suit the setting and the audience. From party music for the young and lively to a more acoustic feel for more formal functions, being flexible with the presentation is a must to fill the need."</p>
